# Important !
This APA 7 style file is **experimental** and **not complete** ! 
However, I want to share it as a starting point, in the hope that it can be extended by someone better at scheme programming than me.

It still has a lot of bugs and a lot of APA 7 requirements are *NOT* implemented.

The bibliography will produce a reasonably correct output if an online source is used. For complex .bib files, it will not display the bibliography correctly, if at all.

Feel free to extend the file as you like :)

*Note: I did not manage to implement the \cite command, so an intext citation will be displayed as [number] instead of APAs (author, year).*
